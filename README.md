# üõ°Ô∏è blocks-lab Project

## Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a cybersecurity lab. In this lab, you can automatically deploy both a server and a victim host as VM instances. The objective is twofold:  
- First, to provide a SIEM server packed with powerful monitoring and management tools, featuring lots of intuitive visualizations.  
- Second, to ensure that this wide functional server can be deployed automatically and quickly on any platform.

At project launch, the supported platform is Ubuntu on AWS, and the SIEM solution is the Wazuh stack.
